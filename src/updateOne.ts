 * v1 strategy: read-merge-write rather than building an `UpdateExpression`.
 * Payload sends a partial `data` patch; DynamoDB `UpdateItem` would let us
 * push the diff server-side, but its expression syntax (reserved words,
 * nested attribute paths, list indexing, removal semantics) is enough work to
 * earn its own milestone. Two round-trips is acceptable for now.
 *
 * `id` on the resulting item always comes from the located target — we don't
 * let `data` rewrite the primary key, which would silently orphan the row.
